# Hapi First Run Test

Express has always been the golden child when it comes to Node back-end frameworks.
Many companies use express and it has definitely a tried and true framework.

_However_, what about other frameworks? What are their pros and cons and how do they weigh against Express?

My first venture in this exploration will be with HapiJS. HapiJs is a framework built by Walmart and is a very popular framework. It's definitely up there, but express is still the king.

The goal of this back-end project will be to build a back-end utilizing HapiJS as the web application framework instead of Express JS.

I will be utilizing a PostgreSQL database along with Sequelize to build this back-end. I will also build a separate api route utilizing only API calls (API TBD).

The goal of this project is to understand a new framework as well as weight the pros and cons of Hapi against Express.
